Planning doc:

SnakeGame():

1. Creates an eventlistner that updates the game 100 frames a second
2. main game loop will do 2 things, move the snake, and redraws the panel by implementing JPanel drawing features
3. uses tiles as a way of positioning compared to using just the pixel locations
4. uses an array of Tiles as a representation of the snake's bodys


What I learned:
1. How to handle grid based moving in simple games
2. Handling game logic, like repaint and move etc
3. Learned basic JPanel draw methods etc
